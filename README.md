## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello!

I am John Biswas, a graduate student at Columbia SEAS. I am studying Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Energy Systems. Some courses that I have taken are Energy Sources & Conversion, Energy Economics & Optimization, Sustainable manufacturing, Fluid Mechanics, Advanced Heat Transfer and Carbon Sequestration. I hope these courses give me foundation that I need to become an energy focused engineer that can work towards a future that is clean and energy abundant.
